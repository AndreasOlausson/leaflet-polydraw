# Docker

## Install Dependencies

Before running any development server, tests, or Docker scripts, make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
# Plugin
cd Leaflet.Polydraw
npm install

# Browser test project
cd ../leaflet-base
npm install

# Docker wrapper project
cd ../Polydraw_Docker
npm install  # Also runs automatically when building via ./build_docker.sh
```

You only need to run this once (or when dependencies change).

The `Polydraw_Docker` directory contains all Docker scripts and wrappers.

## For Development:

```bash
cd Polydraw_Docker
npm run dev              # Builds a fresh plugin and starts the development server
```

- A fresh build of the Leaflet.Polydraw plugin is generated before launching the Vite dev server

## Plugin Tests (Leaflet.Polydraw)

To run unit and integration tests for the Leaflet.Polydraw plugin in isolation:

```bash
cd Leaflet.Polydraw
npm test
```

- Uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## Build Type Definitions

To generate `.d.ts` files for the plugin:

```bash
cd Leaflet.Polydraw
npm run build:types
```

- This uses the script:

```json
"build:types": "tsc --project tsconfig.build.json"
```

## For Docker Build:

```bash
# Must be run from project root
./build_docker.sh       # Builds Docker image with compiled plugin
```

## For Docker Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
# Must be run from project root
./run_tests.sh
```

## Aggressive Docker Cleanup

A helper script is included to **aggressively remove all Docker-related data** (containers, images, volumes, caches, etc).  
This is **potentially destructive** and must be used with care.

```bash
# Must be run from project root
./clean_docker.sh wipe
```

- The script only executes if run with the `wipe` argument
- Without the argument, it does nothing and prints a warning
- Intended for complete cleanup before rebuilding or diagnosing Docker issues
- Note: `build_docker.sh` does **not** call this script, even with arguments â€” cleanup must be run manually if needed.

This setup allows you to develop, test, and deploy Polydraw in a fully containerized environment.
