# Roadmap & Future Improvements

This section outlines planned fixes and new features. Contributions are highly welcome!

## Fixes and Core Improvements

- **Bezier Curve Refinement**: Improve the bezier curve algorithm for more intuitive results.
- **Simplification Algorithm Review**: Make simplification less aggressive and more predictable.
- **Visual Optimization for Complex Polygons**: Smartly hide markers on complex polygons to reduce clutter while retaining functionality.

## New Features

- **Polygon Splitting Tool**: A mode to split a polygon by drawing a line across it.
- **Undo/Redo History**: Add undo/redo capabilities for all editing actions.
- **Measurement Tool**: A tool for measuring distances and areas without creating permanent polygons.
- **Multi-Select and Edit**: Allow users to edit multiple polygons at once.
- **Geo-data Format Integration**: Add helpers for importing/exporting GeoJSON, WKT, or KML.

## Low Priority Ideas

- **Topological Operations**: Add advanced GIS operations like intersection and buffering.
- **Drawing with Curves**: Allow drawing curved segments in point-to-point mode.
- **Theming and Customization**: Expand the config to allow for full theming.
- **Extensible Menu**: Allow developers to add custom actions to the menu.
- **Vertex Snapping**: Add snapping to a grid or other features.
