# Polydraw TODO List

## Known Issues

### üêõ Green Hole Bug (Minor)

**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Identified  
**Description:** When performing a complex sequence of operations (adding polygons, dragging, drawing overlapping areas, subtracting, then dragging a polygon with modifier key), a "green hole" appears in the polygon.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Add a few polygons by dragging
2. Draw an overlapping polygon
3. Subtract a bit from the polygon
4. Drag a polygon while holding the modifier key
5. Result: Green hole appears

**Impact:** Visual rendering issue, doesn't affect core functionality
**Investigation Needed:** Check polygon styling and hole rendering logic in modifier drag operations
